As well as the regular mininet dependencies (OVS...), this project requires quagga.
Download latest tarball from http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/quagga/. (I used quagga-0.99.24.tar.gz).
Unpack, cd in and build (I used "autoreconf -ivf ; ./configure --enable-vtysh --disable-doc ; make ; sudo make install").
You should also create a quagga user: "sudo adduser quagga".

PS - you may need libreadline, gawk, ... : apt install -y libreadline6-dev ...
