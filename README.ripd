README.ripd

this topology uses RIP to enable connectivity between h? hosts.
the configuration files are all entirely generic.
Only the state files (log/api/pid) need to be isolated.
The scripts ripd.sh and zebra.sh should be executed in separate directories for each routing instance.
The conf files should be located in the directory above.
Take care to remove stale PID files!
